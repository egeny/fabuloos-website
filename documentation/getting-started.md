# Getting started

Fabuloos is pretty easy to setup, no matter the coding langage. It will take you a few seconds to get the player up and working on your web page or application.

But first, a quick **ProTip** for easing your documentation's use. Since fabuloos is multi-platform, you will often find this kind of controls:

{% include platform-chooser.html %}

It will display the code and some useful platform-related tips for the selectedâ€¦ platform (I'm sure you've guessed it already). Oh, and as a bonus, your browser will remember which platform you have selected across the documentation's pages.

Give it a try now to see the few steps in embedding fabuloos in your project:

{% include getting-started.html %}

Now, let's go a little deeper into the rabbit's hole.

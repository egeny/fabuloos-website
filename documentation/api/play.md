Wellâ€¦ Launch the playback.

{% alert %}
This method does nothing if there is no renderer. (Duh!)
{% endalert %}

{% alert info %}
Launching the playback doesn't always result to a playback (the client have to buffer the media).  
That's why there are a [`play`](/documentation/events.html) and [`playing`](/documentation/events.html) event.

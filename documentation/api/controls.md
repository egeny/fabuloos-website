This method allows you to get or set the `controls` property of the player.

<div class="alert alert-info">
	<strong>ProTipsâ„¢:</strong> Most of the time you will disable the native HTML5 controls to provide your fancy HTML/CSS/JS controls.
</div>

## Example:
```javascript
player.controls(); // Return the state of the player's controls
player.controls( false ); // Disable the native controls
```

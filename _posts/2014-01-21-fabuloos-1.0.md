We are excited to announce to the world the birth of fabuloos, an initiative for standardizing media playback across web browsers and devices.

This is not just another HTML5 player with Flash fallback like [JWPlayer](http://www.jwplayer.com) or [Video.js](http://www.videojs.com) which are primitive, closed-garden and inefficient. Forget them.

Fabuloos is a radically faster, cleaner and simpler approach for creating top quality media players based on open standards.

Fabuloos offers an unique and intuitive API for media playback no matter the development environment. It comes with the first release of the [Javascript SDK](/download/) which is the most solid, lightweight, and we dare to say powerful yet.

Enjoy using fabuloos to play a video on a single web page or create interactions between the video and your page. Open your mind to new possibilities, they are infinite.

[Start playing](/documentation/getting-started.html) with fabuloos and try to amaze us!

A lot more is coming soon. Stay tuned!

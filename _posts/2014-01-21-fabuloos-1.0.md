We are excited to announce to the world the birth of [Fabuloos](http://www.fabuloos.org), an initiative for <strong>standardizing media playback</strong> across web browsers and devices.

Fabuloos is a radically faster, cleaner and simpler approach for creating top quality media players based on open standards.

This is not another HTML5 player with Flash fallback like [JWPlayer](http://www.jwplayer.com) or [Video.js](http://www.videojs.com) which are primitive, closed-gardens and not really effective. Forget all of them.

Code once and for all. Fabuloos offers a unique and intuitive API for media playback whatever the development environment. It comes with the first release of the [Javascript SDK](/download/) which is the most solid, lightweight, and we dare to say powerful yet.

We hope you will enjoy using fabuloos to play a video on a single web page or create magnificent interactions between the video and your page. Open your mind to new possibilities, the sky is the limit!

A lot more is coming soon. Stay tuned!

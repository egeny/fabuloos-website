We are excited to announce to the world the birth of [Fabuloos](http://www.fabuloos.org), an initiative for <strong>standardizing media playback</strong> across web browsers and devices.

Fabuloos is a radically faster, cleaner and simpler approach for creating top quality media players based on open standards. 

This is not another HTML5 player with Flash fallback like [JWPlayer](http://www.jwplayer.com) or [Video.js](http://www.videojs.com) which are primitives, closed-gardens and not really effective. Forget all of them. 

Code once and for all. Fabuloos offers an unique and intuitive API for media playback whatever the development environment. It comes with the first release of the [Javascript SDK](/download/) which is the most solid, lightweight, and we dare to say powerful yet.

We hope you will [enjoy](/documentation/getting-started.html) using Fabuloos to play a video on a single web page or create magnificent interactions between the video and your page. Open your mind to new possibilities, they are absolutely infinite.

A lot more is coming soon. Stay tuned!

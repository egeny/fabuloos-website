<h3>Create mobiles applications with videos is a repetitive and boring work, because it takes time and energy to code and debug limited natives players</h3>
<h4>With fabuloos you can easily embed videos in your apps.</h4>

<p>Get started building applications with either the Fabuloos SDK for Android or the fabuloos SDK for iOS. The SDK helps remove complexity by providing APIs and hiding much of the lower-level plumbing of the web service interface, including authentication, request retries, and error handling. For each plateform, the single, downloadable package includes the fabuloos Library, code samples, and documentation.</p>

<p>With a Basic Plus or Premium account, you can quickly access to mobile ad networks and advertising solutions. The SDK enables mobile app developers to maximize their monetization on Android, or iOS by tapping into a vast combined pool of advertisers.</p>

<p>Other benefits include support for new ad formats and tablet-specific formats. Creatives represent rich, immersive HTML5 user experiences, and may implement a variety of calls-to-action. The app's ads can be targeted by demographics and location.</p>

<h3>Your videos reach a great audience but as fragmentation continues, it’s harder to understand usage</h3>
<h4>Collect Data and Grow your Audience.</h4>

<p>With an audience watching your video on more platforms and devices than ever before, it's important to be able to understand which platforms they're using to access your content.</p>

<p>We designed Fabuloos statistics to be able to be used alongside the other powerful analytics packages available today, giving you an even greater level of flexibility and insight into your traffic. While there are a number of analytics packages available that can easily be integrated with fabuloos, none of them provide a truly universal overview of your site's video traffic - broken down by device type or browser version and HTML5 or Flash playback.</p>

<p>Fabuloos’s Big Data Architecture and powerful video analytics tools are the core of our technology platform. This allows us to collect data from all platforms and present a comprehensive, universal overview of your site’s video traffic - all in real-time. This helps you to better understand your audience and measure the real success of your videos.</p>

# About US

### Who we are

Fabuloos might have started out as just an idea in eGeny founder Jérôme Bourreau-Guggenheim's head, but it's come a long way since then. Our team is now made up of 4 dedicated, creative, and totally driven people, led by our ingenious Product Director Nicolas Le Gall. Armed with nothing more than our wits, some comfy chairs and a fleet of steely Macs, our sole purpose is help Fabuloos users accomplish everything they set out to do.

### What we think

Fabuloos' philosophy is pretty simple when it comes down to it: make it easy for people to work the way they want to work, wherever and with whomever. The last thing we want is to force... We care deeply about the Web and are committed to making contributions that push it forward.

### What we're doing

Fabuloos started in 2010 as the world’s first cloud-based HTML5 Video player; a pioneering solution that provides Web publishers with a fast, pain-free way to truly embrace and enable HTML5 and allows their videos to play flawlessly on any device, browser and web page. We're constantly evolving and adapting to meet their needs, with new features and product updates released almost every week. Feel free to check out our Productivity Blog to see some of what we've done recently, or follow us on Twitter and Facebook to be the first to hear about future developments.

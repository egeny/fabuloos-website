<h2>How it works?</h2>

<h4>Step 1: Include the Fabuloos.js Javascript in your page</h4>

<p>You can download the Fabuloos.js source and host it on your own servers, or use the free CDN hosted version. It's often recommended now to put JavaScript before the end body tag (</body>) instead of the head (<head>).</p>

<pre>
&lt;script src="http://fabuloos.org/js/fabuloos.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Step 2: Add an HTML5 video tag to your page</h4>

<p>With Fabuloos.js you just use an HTML5 video tag to embed a video. Fabuloos.js will then read the tag and make it work in all browsers, not just ones that support HTML5 video.</p>

<pre>
&lt;video id="example_video" class="video-fab"
  controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360"
&lt;source src="http://fabuloos.org/clip.mp4" type='video/mp4' /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Alternative Setup</h4>

<p>Beyond the basic markup, Fabuloos.js needs a few extra pieces.</p>

<pre>
&lt;video id="example_video" class="video-fab"
  controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360"
  poster="http://fabuloos.org/preview.png"
  data-setup='{"example_option":true}'&gt;
...
&lt;/video&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Why Fabuloos?</h2>

<div class="content">

	<p class="lead">We build a framework that hide all this complexity and heterogeneity from the developer to play video and media on any device.</p>

	<p>Fabuloos' philosophy is pretty simple when it comes down to it: make it easy for people to work the way they want to work, wherever and with whomever.</p>

	<p> Fabuloos' Framework abstracts the creation of video players and enhance existing natives players.</p>

	<p> It's Multi-platform consistent. Fabuloos enables HTML5 Video with invisible Flash fallback based on browser/device capabilities and specific media type. Wide mobile device support allows your videos to play seamlessly on iPhones, iPads, Android, Windows and almost any other platforms.</p>

	<p>Fabuloos framework have the following characteristics:</p>

	<dl>
	  <dt>Abstraction</dt>
	  <dd>It should provide a new level of abstraction which would hide all the complexity of various web technologies. In other words, the developer should no longer worry about which web technology he should use to have his player running on any browsing platform.</dd>

	  <dt>Single codebase</dt>
	  <dd>The framework should provide the developer or the designer with a simple way to program his player just once using a single JavaScript codebase which works on absolutely any platform, either desktop or touch, without the need for modifications or hacks. Simply the Holy Grail for any developer.</dd>

	  <dt>Technologies harmonization</dt>
	  <dd>It should have the knowledge to automatically and transparently use every appropriate technology on any browser to perform any action necessary, such as drawing a button, playing a video; absolutely any action and with no limitations, from the old IE6 to modern tablets such as the Nexus or the iPad.</dd>

	  <dt>Fully Modular</dt>
	  <dd>Its architecture should be modular in order to allow the creation of any new functionality in the form of a plug-in.</dd>

	  <dt>Support standards</dt>
	  <dd>We care deeply about the Web and are committed to making contributions that push it forward.</dd>

	</dl>

	<p>Fabuloos framework is the ultimate solution to solve the huge problem of devices, browsers and web technologies fragmentation, and more importantly, it could solve them in a fully scalable way, leading to the possibility of quickly producing and easily maintaining hundreds of different state-of-the-art video players.</p>

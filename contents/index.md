### Fabuloos, a Smart Way to Play On Any Device

Introducing Fabuloos, the Framework that finally sparks the HTML5 Video revolution, by enabling full graphic freedom and features modularity, working perfectly on any browser and the latest mobile platforms.

No download, no installation: Sign up for free today and be up and running in few seconds. It couldn’t be simpler to integrate fabuloos into your site, just add a single line of code to enable it on your page.

Fabuloos enables HTML5 Video with invisible Flash fallback based on browser/device capabilities and specific media type. Wide mobile device support allows your videos to play seamlessly on iPhones, iPads, Android, Windows and almost any other platforms.

## You store videos on YouTube (or  another online video plateforms) but you want to use them in a branded player

### Always Keep Full Control of your Videos

We provide the video player, while you keep full control of your videos by freely using your preferred hosting and encoding service(s). Your videos can be hosted anywhere, including Brightcove, Ooyala, Vimeo, Amazon S3, or YouTube.

Our Publishing Assistant lets you create, in few steps, a complete branded player with your logo on video. The rendering of every control and UI element is resolution independent and delivers a pixel-perfect rendering on Full HD displays.

The Fabuloos API gives you the ability to control the player via JavaScript and easily implement custom and advanced functionality. You can easily plug a powerful, high volume video system directly into your website, application or CMS. 

## Create mobiles applications with videos is a repetitive and boring work, because it takes time and energy to code and debug limited natives players

### With fabuloos you can easily embed videos in your apps.

Get started building applications with either the Fabuloos SDK for Android or the fabuloos SDK for iOS. The SDK helps remove complexity by providing APIs and hiding much of the lower-level plumbing of the web service interface, including authentication, request retries, and error handling.. 
For each plateform, the single, downloadable package includes the fabuloos Library, code samples, and documentation.

With a Basic Plus or Premium account, you can quickly access to mobile ad networks and advertising solutions. The SDK enables mobile app developers to maximize their monetization on Android, or iOS by tapping into a vast combined pool of advertisers.

Other benefits include support for new ad formats and tablet-specific formats. Creatives represent rich, immersive HTML5 user experiences, and may implement a variety of calls-to-action. The app's ads can be targeted by demographics and location.

## Your videos reach a great audience but as fragmentation continues, it’s harder to understand usage

### Collect Data and Grow your Audience

With an audience watching your video on more platforms and devices than ever before, it's important to be able to understand which platforms they're using to access your content.
 
We designed Fabuloos statistics to be able to be used alongside the other powerful analytics packages available today, giving you an even greater level of flexibility and insight into your traffic. While there are a number of analytics packages available that can easily be integrated with fabuloos, none of them provide a truly universal overview of your site's video traffic - broken down by device type or browser version and HTML5 or Flash playback. 

Fabuloos’s Big Data Architecture and powerful video analytics tools are the core of our technology platform. This allows us to collect data from all platforms and present a comprehensive, universal overview of your site’s video traffic - all in real-time. This helps you to better understand your audience and measure the real success of your videos.

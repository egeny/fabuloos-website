<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>Fabuloos' philosophy is pretty simple when it comes down to it: make it easy for people to work the way they want to work, wherever and with whomever. The last thing we want is to force... We care deeply about the Web and are committed to making contributions that push it forward.</p>

<p>We build a framework that hide all this complexity and heterogeneity from the developer to play video and media on any device.</p>

<p>Fabuloos enables HTML5 Video with invisible Flash fallback based on browser/device capabilities and specific media type. Wide mobile device support allows your videos to play seamlessly on iPhones, iPads, Android, Windows and almost any other platforms.</p>

<p>Fabuloos framework have the following characteristics:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Abstraction</dt>
  <dd>It should provide a new level of abstraction which would hide all the complexity of various web technologies. In other words, the developer should no longer worry about which web technology he should use to have his player running on any browsing platform.</dd>

  <dt>Single codebase</dt>
  <dd>The framework should provide the developer or the designer with a simple way to program his player just once using a single JavaScript codebase which works on absolutely any platform, either desktop or touch, without the need for modifications or hacks. Simply the Holy Grail for any developer.</dd>

  <dt>Technologies harmonization</dt>
  <dd>It should have the knowledge to automatically and transparently use every appropriate technology on any browser to perform any action necessary, such as drawing a button, playing a video; absolutely any action and with no limitations, from the old IE6 to modern tablets such as the Nexus or the iPad.</dd>

  <dt>Fully Modular</dt>
  <dd>Its architecture should be modular in order to allow the creation of any new functionality in the form of a plug-in.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Fabuloos framework is the ultimate solution to solve the huge problem of devices, browsers and web technologies fragmentation, and more importantly, it could solve them in a fully scalable way, leading to the possibility of quickly producing and easily maintaining hundreds of different state-of-the-art video players.</p>
